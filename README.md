# 2ch.hk_img_dwnldr

My first ever java project.
2ch.hk (the most popular imageboard in exUSSR countries) mediacontent downloader.
Two modes:
	- download with direct URL to thread;
	- download first page of thematic board;

TODO:
1. add exceptions:
	-- incorrect URL path to thread or incorrect board name;
2. edit switch statement; 
3. download full board (all pages);
4. download in specific path %hard_drive%://%user_path%/%thematic_board_name%/%thread_number%/;
5. maybe wil try to make gui (using Swing, keke);
